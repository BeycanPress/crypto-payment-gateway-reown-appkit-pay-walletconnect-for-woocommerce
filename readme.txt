== Description ==

### Crypto Payment Gateway with Reown AppKit Pay (WalletConnect) for WooCommerce

Right after Reown announced AppKit Pay, we got to work integrating it with WooCommerce. This initial version—set to be improved further in the future—is now available. All you need to do is enter your wallet address in the settings and create an AppKit ID (Project ID) via Reown Cloud. That’s it! You can now accept crypto payments directly through WooCommerce using Reown (WalletConnect) AppKit Pay.

See AppKit Pay here: https://docs.reown.com/appkit/payments/overview#appkit-pay

CryptoPay differs from this plugin in that we are the main developer and therefore we are constantly bringing new blockchain network support. However, since the Reown team is the main developer of the Reown plugin, you can't get paid from networks that they don't support.

For example, CryptoPay supports networks like TON, XRP and Tron, which are not yet supported in AppKit.
